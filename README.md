#### Enter and validate employment date

- When the user enters the employment date, the input is validated to ensure that it is in the correct date format.

#### Enter and validate holiday entitlement

- When the user enters their holiday entitlement the input is converted to an integer, the validate function controls that it is at least 25 days (which is the minimum by law) and that the format is correct.

#### Enter and validate absence data

- When the user enters their absence data the input is converted to an integer. The validate function controls the format of the input and print out if it's not valid.

#### Calculate employment days

- The function calculates how many employment days the user got during the vacation year by comparing the employment date with the last day of the vacation year.

#### Calculate paid vacation days

- The function calculates how many paid vacation days the user will get. It reduces leave of absence from total employment days. In the next step, the remaining days are related to the days in the current vacation year and are multiplied by the vacation entitlement. At last the result is being rounded up just as it should be according to the law.
